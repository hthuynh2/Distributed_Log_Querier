RUNNING
-------
To run client program: ./client_main
To run server program: ./server_main
Run client program on the querying machine
Run server program on all VMs that act as the server. Need to run the server program on remote VMs before querying.
While client program is running, use the following command to query for PATTERN: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN 
Note: The program only query file with name vm<i>.log (with i is the number of VM) in out directory. Therefore, need to create .log files in out directory in each VM before running program

Step 1 : Copy the .log files in Unit Test Input directory to out directory (e.g. vm1.log for VM1, vm2.log for VM2,..)
Step 2 : run ./server_main on any 4 VMs from 1 to 5.
Step 3 : Run: ./client_main unit_test on the remain VM
